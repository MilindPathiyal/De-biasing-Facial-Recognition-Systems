# De-biasing-Facial-Recognition-Systems

My second lab in 6.S191
MIT-6.S191-Lab-2: De-biasing Facial Recognition Systems

Part 1: MNIST Digit Classification
In the first portion of this lab, we will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Our classes are the digits 0-9.


Part 2: Debiasing Facial Detection Systems
In the second portion of the lab, we'll explore two prominent aspects of applied deep learning: facial detection and algorithmic bias.
Deploying fair, unbiased AI systems is critical to their long-term acceptance. Consider the task of facial detection: given an image, is it an image of a face? This seemingly simple, but extremely important, task is subject to significant amounts of algorithmic bias among select demographics.
In this lab, we'll investigate one recently published approach to addressing algorithmic bias. We'll build a facial detection model that learns the latent variables underlying face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a debiased model.
